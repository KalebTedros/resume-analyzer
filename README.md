# resume-analyzer
A web application built in a cloud development environment (GitHub Codespaces) that allows a user to paste a job description. The application uses an AI library to analyze the text, extracting key skills and terms, and then compares them against your own resume (a text file) to generate a "match score" and show missing keywords.
