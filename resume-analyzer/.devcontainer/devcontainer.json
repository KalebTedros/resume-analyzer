// "image": ...: This defines the base Linux environment with Python 3.9 already installed.

// "postCreateCommand": ...: This runs once when the Codespace is first built. It installs all the Python packages from your requirements.txt file.

// "postAttachCommand": ...: This is the magic part. It runs every time you connect to the Codespace. It automatically starts your Streamlit app.

// "forwardPorts": [8501]: This ensures the port for Streamlit (8501) is automatically opened.
